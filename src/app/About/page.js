                <b className='text-xl'>My Journey üó∫Ô∏è</b>
                My journey began with a hands-on Software Developer Internship at Spatialty.ai, where I took the lead in creating a web application prototype and an admin dashboard using Next.js and Django. My work wasn't just about code‚Äîit was about solving complex challenges. I implemented secure JWT authentication and integrated Leaflet maps and Chart.js for visualization and analytics. I even used Redis caching to boost system efficiency by a staggering 99%. Beyond this, I've built personal projects like a real-time chat app and a news-scraping tool, showcasing my proficiency with technologies like Next.js, Express.js, Docker, and AWS.
